# friendlyreminder
A simple app that helps you to send a nice message to a (random) friend, co-worker, or family member (with weighted probabilities). Your computer picks the lucky one for today.

## Instructions
* Add names in the names array
* Change probability weights in the weight function. You may want to call your mother more often than your mother in law or *vice versa*

## Example
[See this CodePen](https://codepen.io/pmkruyen/pen/QWpepwK)

## Credits 
Nenad Vracar and Michael Czechowski for the adapted random weight function.
Kirilv for the inspiring firework.
